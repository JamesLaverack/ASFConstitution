\section*{The Society Notes}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item In light of the societyâ€™s unique goal, in providing the best anime, fantasy, manga and science/speculative fiction to the populace of Bristol Students Union, the society resolves to bestow fitting titles upon its committee.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{The Society Believes}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item That though titles may be different, the basic functions of a committee must be retained. Hence, renaming of current positions will transfer all current responsibilities unto the new title.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{The Society Resolves}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item To change the society constitution in order to change all references to the committee by amending the constitution as follows:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item President shall henceforth be known as Brigade Chief
    \item Vice President shall henceforth be known as Rear Admiral
    \item Secretary shall henceforth be known as Librarian
    \item Treasurer shall henceforth be known as Soldier of Fortune
    \item Conventions Secretary shall henceforth be known as Watcher
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
