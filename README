# Using the amendment-tools
To create a draft, amended version of the constitution first put `\include{amendment-tools}` in the preamble of the ASFConstitution. Then put the command `\amendmentintro` between the `\maketile` command and the start of the text.

From here, simply surround removed text with \proposeddel{} and added text with \proposedadd{}.
